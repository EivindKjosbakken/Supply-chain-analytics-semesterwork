This is from two of the tasks in the supply chain analytics project. In the simulation file we have coded in a simulation of the situation: A machine with the probability of
failing, and a probability of being repaired, both are exponentially distributed and we pick random values (according to the distributions) from there. Then we simulate a lot of 
days so we could get an accurate estimate for how many hours the machine is down each day (on average)
In the markov analysis we implement markov analysis to solve a similar problem (figure out how many hours a machine is down, this time though, we also have a backup machine to 
consider, so we have three states, with different probabilites to go to and from each state, and we solve the problem with markov analysis.
